# How to run it
To run Mxious, run the following in terminal:

    git clone https://github.com/mxious/mxious.git
    python3 manage.py migrate
    python3 manage.py runserver
That should get you up and running. Some tips though:

1. Try to use a virtualenv, it helps.
2. Mxious depends on a few packages: Django, crispy_forms, coverpy. They are inside requirements.txt.
